## STEP
There are many step to execute Machine Learning Model. The data should be clean (No Outliers, No Missing Data)
### 1. Removing Outliers
From the raw data set, there are a few Outliers, and need to be remove.
### 2. Handling with Missing Data
After the removing outliers, we must handling the missing data, such drop the row/columns or fill the missing data with value
### 3. Handling the Object Data
Set the Object Data into numeric data
### 4. Performing the Machine Learning Model
Final Step is Performing the Machine Learning model to get predicted price and show the performance
- Separate the feature and label
- Do the Train test split (to get training data and testing data)
- Scaling data
- Make a model
- Doing Cross Validation (GridSearchCV)
- Fit the Model
- Get Predict
- Reporting the Performance Model
